# Industria

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weinholt/industria.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weinholt/industria)

Industria is a collection of portable R6RS Scheme libraries for
cryptography. It implements low-level algorithms like AES, RSA, DSA,
ECDSA, etc and high-level protocols such as OpenPGP, Off-The-Record
messaging, DNS and Secure Shell (SSH).

Many of the libraries that were previously part of Industria have been
removed in version 2.0.0. See [NEWS.org](NEWS.org) for the new
locations of these libraries.
